<h1>Interview with my Sister</h1>

<p>
<b>Interviewer</b>: Most people haven't been taught about restorative justice, or like even know about it. Do you know anything about it?<br><br>
 
<b>Sister</b>: I think I've heard about it... (coughs) I don’t really know what it is exactly.<br><br>

I think Harvest does something related to it though since Martin used to mention it sometimes.<br><br>
 
<b>Interviewer</b>: Can you elaborate?<br><br>
 
<b>Sister</b>: Yeah so we have R&R, which is basically where they take a student and a teacher who have a problem, or two students that have a problem, and have a weird type of hearing almost, and they have a facilitator as well. From what I’ve heard you just talk until you’re able to work out the issue.<br><br>
 
<b>Interviewer</b>: That's actually similar to many of the practices used in restorative justice. Our school uses more restorative justice based approaches than the typical expel or suspend kind of stuff. (pauses) Do you agree with that?<br><br>
 
<b>Sister</b>: I think it’s a lot better to be honest, cause usually what ends up happening with the normal system is like, the kid doesn’t even really know what they did or learn their lesson, and nothing really gets resolved.<br><br>

The way our school does it-- or, (coughs) or like the way restorative justice does it seems like it actually tries to fix the problem.<br><br>
 
<b>Interviewer</b>: Ok. (pauses) Do you think that there should be more restorative justice kind of approaches applied to our justice system, rather than what we have now?<br><br>
 
<b>Sister</b>: Oh yeah definitely. All the current system does is keep people imprisoned, like it doesn’t actually do anything except just that, and especially people of color are imprisoned.<br><br>

<b>Interviewer</b>: Will you look more into or like, research restorative justice more?<br><br>
 
<b>Sister</b>: I mean I’ll try maybe, since it’s interesting I might but no promises.<br><br>
