<h1>The History of Restorative Justice?</h1>

<p>Restorative justice has quite a long history, while only spanning a few decades in the West, it has been in practice by many other cultures for centuries. Initially, restorative justice began as a field that cropped up during the 1970s in response as an alternative to the court process. Many of the teachings of restorative justice can be traced back to indigenous cultures, which had been practicing restorative justice for many years. The restorative justice movement developed alongside the victims’ rights movement, which fought to involve crime victims in the criminal justice process, similarly to restorative justice in some cases. However, what is considered the official start of what we now see as the restorative justice movement began from an experiment in Kitchener, Ontario in 1974. This case required that two teenagers who had vandalized 22 people’s properties to pay restitution to each and every one of them. From this moment on dozens of experiments throughout the late 70s to the early 80s were formed in a similar way to the Kitchener program. These had little impact though. This all changed in 1994 when it was beginning to look like restorative justice would have a larger impact on the mainstream when the American Bar Association endorsed victim offender mediation. This was a program that was usually only associated with minor crimes and first time offenders. Due to this, a plethora of other organizations also voiced support such as the National Organization for Victim Assistance. What started as a tiny field in the 1970s has now blossomed into over thirty states now having instated restorative justice principles in their policy plans and mission statements promoting a healthier restorative juvenile justice system, and so on.</p>
