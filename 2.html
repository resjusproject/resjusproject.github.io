<h1>Restorative Justice Practices</h1>

<p>There are a myriad of practices used in restorative justice to facilitate healing. One of these practices are “peacemaking circles” or “repair of harm circles”. Circles are primarily focused on the harm done to the community, such as the community of a classroom. While circles are focused on the harm done to the community, they are also focused on building and healing the community as well. Circles allow everyone’s voice to be heard and uplifts them. Another restorative justice practice is one of the most widely used one and oldest is victim offender mediation. Circles are also often used in educational settings, which seek to provide support instead of suspending or expelling students. Victim offender mediation includes the victim(s) and the offender(s) in the same room, usually sitting face to face, with an outsider who serves to function as the facilitator. During victim offender mediation the main focus is to identify what has happened, discuss the impact, come to a common consensus, and then to find a way to heal or attempt to heal what has happened. The mediation is also sometimes accompanied by a support group which can consist of friends or family.</p>
